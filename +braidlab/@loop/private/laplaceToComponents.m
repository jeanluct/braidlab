% Compute connected components in a graph using graph Laplacian.
%
% Number of components is the dimension of the kernel of the
% Laplacian.  Zero-eigenvectors are constant on components of the
% graph. The components can be identify solely from signs of
% eigenvectors, as the positive and negative values of the
% eigenvectors will partition the graph into two, along component
% boundaries. For different eigenvectors partitions will be different,
% so we can take mutual intersections of such partitions to recover
% all components.
%
% Numerically, this is done by treating + and - signs as binary
% digits and the list of + and - corresponding to each vertex gives
% a binary representation of the component to which the vertex belongs.
%
% *** Inputs: ***
% Lp - graph Laplacian (square, real, symmetric, sparse matrix)
%
% *** Outputs: ***
%
% vertexComponent - each element corresponds to a vertex in the graph
% and elements store component numbers
%
% Nc - number of components; dimension of the kernel of the laplacian
% is the number of components
%
%
%   This is a method for the LOOP class.
