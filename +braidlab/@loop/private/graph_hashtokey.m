function PV = graph_hashtokey( I, M, T )
%% PV = hashtokey( I, M, T )
%
% Returns the key - a pair (puncture index, vertex index) from a
% linear index.
%
% PV - pair [puncture index, vertex index]
% 
% M - vector of intersection number for coordinate lines above
%     punctures 
%  
% T - cumulative sum (1, 1+2, 1+2+3, ...) over P intersection
%     numbers for coordinate lines at punctures
%
% A more detailed explanation
% LOOP GRAPH INDEXING
% 
% The loop graph represents loops using a graph in which vertices
% are intersections of loops with Dynnikov coordinate lines 
% above and below punctures.
%  
% Each vertex is indexed by a pair (P,V) where P corresponds to 
% the puncture the vertex is associated to, P = 1, ..., n
% V is the order of the vertex above (V > 0) or below (V < 0) the puncture.
% For each P,
%    max(V) == M(P)
%    min(V) == -N(P)
% 
% Where M and N are intersection numbers with, respectively, lines
% above and below punctures.
%
% This function is the inverse of loop/private/keytohash.
%
%   This is a method for the LOOP class.
%   See also LOOP.
