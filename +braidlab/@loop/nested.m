function lvl = nested(obj)
%NESTED   Nesting level of loop.
%   LVL = NESTED(L) returns the nesting level of a loop.  This is the
%   GCD of all the loop coordinate entries, minus one.  If the loop is
%   not nested, then LVL=0.  If the loop is doubled, LVL=1, etc.
%
%   This is a method for the LOOP class.
%   See also LOOP.
