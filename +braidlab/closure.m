function XYc = closure(XY,ctype)
%CLOSURE   Force closure of a set of trajectories to make a physical braid.
%   XYC = CLOSURE(XY) or XYC = CLOSURE(XY,'Xproj') takes the particle
%   trajectory data in XY and appends the initial positions to the end of
%   the list.  The order is chosen so that no new crossings are created
%   (when projected along the X axis).  The data format is
%   XY(TIMESTEP,COORD,PARTICLES).
%
%   XYC = CLOSURE(XY,'mindist') closes the trajectories to minimize the sum
%   of the Euclidean distances between the final and initial points.  This
%   uses Markus Buehren's implementation of the Hungarian algorithm for the
%   optimal assigment problem.
%   (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6543)
%
%   XYC = CLOSURE(XY,PERM) closes the braid so that final points are
%   linked according to permutation PERM.
