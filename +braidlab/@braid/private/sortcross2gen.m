function [gen,tcr] = sortcross2gen(n,crossdat)
%SORTCROSS2GEN   Convert sorted crossing data to generators.
%   [GEN,TCR] = SORTCROSS2GEN(CROSSDAT)
%   CROSSDAT is the output of SORTCROSS.
%
%   To determine the generator, the crossings have to be applied to the
%   particle order.  The location of the lower string in the crossing will
%   be the magnitude of the generator.  The direction of crossing calculated
%   earlier is then applied to get the generator value.
%
%   This is a helper function for CROSS2GEN.
