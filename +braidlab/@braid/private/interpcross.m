%INTERPCROSS   Interpolate a crossing.
%   [TC,DY] = INTERPCROSS(T,X,Y,ITC,P1,P2) is a helper function for
%   GENCROSS.  The input is the data T,X,Y (described in the help for
%   GENCROSS); the index ITC of the time of crossing (i.e., the particles
%   cross between T(ITC) and T(ITC+1); and the indices P1 and P2 of the two
%   particles that are crossing.  INTERPCROSS returns the interpolated
%   crossing time TC, as well as DY (the sign of the difference in Y
%   coordinates) which determines the sign of the generator.  ITC can also
%   be passed as a vector, in which case TC and DY will also be vectors.
