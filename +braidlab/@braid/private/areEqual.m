function result = areEqual(A,B,precision) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%AREEQUAL   Check for equality within given precision.
%   AREEQUAL(A,B,PRECISION) Checks if elements of A and B are within
%   10^PRECISION (int exponent) float-representable numbers.
%
%   Returns a logical matrix of size equal to A and B containing results of
%   tests.
%
%   AREEQUAL is implemented as a MATLAB MEX file. This file holds only its
%   documentation.
%
%   Example
%      A = rand(10,10);
%      areEqual(A,A+5*eps(A),5)
%      areEqual(A,A+5*eps(A),3)
