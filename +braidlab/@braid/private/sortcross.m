function crossdat = sortcross(cross_cell)
%SORTCROSS   Sort crossing times.
%   CROSSDAT = SORTCROSS(CROSS_CELL)
%   CROSS_CELL contains the crossing times and directions for string pairings
%   which are initially in the order I,J along the projection line.  These
%   have to be sorted chronologically and validated.
%
%   CROSSDAT will be a matrix with crossing information:
%   Column 1: time;
%   Column 2: direction;
%   Column 3: leftmost string;
%   Column 4: rightmost string.
%
%   This is a helper function for CROSS2GEN.
