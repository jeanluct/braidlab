function [gen,tcr,cross_cell] = cross2gen(XYtraj,t,delta)
%CROSS2GEN   Convert a physical braid to a list of braid generators.
%   The order of each particle is determined according to its first (X)
%   coordinate.  Crossing happens when the X coordinate of two particles
%   match.  The second coordinate Y is used to determine whether the
%   particles exchanged their position in a clockwise or counter-clockwise
%   manner.
%
%   Output:
%
%   GEN - vector of integers corresponding to the sequence of
%   generators
%
%   TCR - vector of (interpolated) times at which generators
%   occurred
%
%   CROSS_CELL - Times at which a crossing occured is then stored into
%   CROSS_CELL in a numerical vector. The cell index (I,J) indicates both the
%   strings involved and the direction of crossing.  For example if strings I
%   and J cross with string I initially left of J, the time of the crossing
%   will be stored in CROSS_CELL(I,J); otherwise the time will be stored in
%   CROSS_CELL(J,I).  The direction of crossing -- either positive or negative
%   -- is saved in the same cell and is used to determine the generator
%   sequence later.  The outer I,J loop is over all pairs of strings.
%
%   This uses two helper functions, SORTCROSS and SORTCROSS2GEN.
