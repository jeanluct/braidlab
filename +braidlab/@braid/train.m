function T = train(b)
%TRAIN   Train track of a braid.
%   T = TRAIN(B) returns a structure T with the train track information for
%   a braid B.  The braid is regarded as labeling an isotopy class on the
%   punctured disk.
%
%   The returned structure T contains the following fields:
%
%   T.braid: the braid itself.
%
%   T.tntype: Thurston type of the isotopy class.  This take the values
%   'finite-order', 'reducible', or 'pseudo-Anosov', following the
%   Thurston-Nielsen classification theorem.
%
%   T.entropy: entropy of the braid.
%
%   T.ttmap: train track map, stored as a cell array of vectors.  For
%   example, edge 2 mapped to the edge sequence [-3 1 2] corresponds to
%   T.ttmap{2} = [-3 1 2].
%
%   T.transmat: transition matrix for the train track map.
%
%   TRAIN uses Toby Hall's implementation of the Bestvina-Handel algorithm.

% There are two types of reducibility.  From trains/graph.h:
%
%    Reducible1 means transition matrix reducible
%    Reducible2 have efficient fibred surface
%
% More info on this in trains frontend's "help gates":
%
%    If the graph map held in memory has been found to represent a
%    pseudo-Anosov isotopy class, or a reducible class for which
%    reducibility has been detected because there is an efficient fibred
%    surface with a vertex at which not all of the gates are connected by
%    infinitesimal edges, then this command will display lists of gates and
%    infinitesimal edges at each vertex. The gates are listed in cyclic
%    (anticlockwise) order around the vertex.
%
% For now, treat these as identical and just set the field to 'reducible'.
