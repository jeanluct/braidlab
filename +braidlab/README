+braidlab: namespace for braidlab library

 * Adding a + to a subfolder name means that if the parent folder is
   on Matlab's path, then functions inside the subfolder can be invoked
   in Matlab as braidlab.<function>.

 * To avoid having to use the braidlab. perfix, a function can import
   the namespace using 'import braidlab.<function>' 'or import
   braidlab.*' to import all functions.

 * The private subfolder is only accessible to functions in the
   containing folder, without needing to include the subfolder on the
   path.

 * Functions in the +braidlab subfolder do *not* automatically see the
   other functions in the folder.  They must use the braidlab. prefix
   or import functions.

 * Subfolders with a + are also allowed.  For instance, a subfolder
   +loop might be a good idea.  The functions therein would be invoked
   with braidlab.loop.<function>.

 * A subfolder beginning with "@" contains a class, such as @braid.
   Subversion has trouble with this, so the folder must be refereed to
   @braid@ within SVN.
