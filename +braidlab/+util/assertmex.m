function out = assertmex(functionname)
%ASSERTMEX   Assert that MEX file exists.
%   ASSERTMEX(functionname) Checks that a mex file "functionname" exists. If
%   it does not exist, the function throws BRAIDLAB:noMEX error.
%
%   OUT = ASSERTMEX(functionname) Returns TRUE if mex file
%   "functionname" exists and FALSE otherwise. No errors are thrown.
%
%   ... = ASSERTMEX; Same as above, except the desired functionname is
%   detected by checking call stack. This can be useful in development
%   stages, but final versions of code should specify function name
%   explicitly to speed up the code.
%
%   Consider also invoking the function as assertmex(mfilename) if
%   the calling function is the first function in an m-file.
