function Nthreads = getAvailableThreadNumber
%%GETAVAILABLETHREADNUMBER
%
% Determines number of threads available, e.g., for use in C++ code.
%
% - First tries to honor global BRAIDLAB_threads.
% - If it is invalid/not available, tries to set number of threads to number
% of available cores.
% - If number of cores cannot be detected, defaults to one thread.
%
% The number of threads is a persistent variable, i.e., it is computed only
% once per MATLAB session. To re-compute the number of threads, run
% >> clear getAvailableThreadNumber
