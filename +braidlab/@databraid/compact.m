function c = compact(b)
%COMPACT   Try to shorten a databraid by cancelling generators.
%   C = COMPACT(B) attempts to shorten a databraid B by cancelling
%   adjacent generators, and returns the shortened databraid C.  The
%   crossing times corresponding to the cancelled generators are
%   dropped from the TCROSS data member of C.
%
%   Note that DATABRAID.COMPACT is less effective than BRAID.COMPACT,
%   since it preserves the order of generators.  It does this in order
%   to maintain the ordering of the crossing times.
%
%   This is a method for the DATABRAID class.
%   See also BRAID.COMPACT.
