1.x.x [2014-xx-xx]

Several improvements to the method braid.entropy:

* It has a C MEX helper function and is much faster.

* Its convergence has been greatly improved (see next item for more
  details).  With enough iterations, machine precision can usually be
  achieved.

* Its optional second return argument has changed from a list of
  iterates to the final generalized eigenvector.  The reason is that
  the internal algorithm has changed: the Dynnikov coordinates get
  renormalized at every step, much like the power iteration method for
  finding the largest eigenvalue of a matrix.  A consequence of this
  is that it is no longer natural to store the iterates.  This
  shouldn't affect things very much, since this optional argument was
  not used widely.

* The maximum number of iterations to try is now determined by using
  the low-entropy psi braids.  The spectral gap of those braids is
  computed using the new function psiroots.  Two caveats: (i) Those
  braids are only known to have lowest entropy for 8 strands or fewer.
  (ii) Even if they have the lowest entropy, they might not have the
  lowest spectral gap.  In practice this shouldn't matter, but this
  method shouldn't be used to prove theorems!

1.0.5 [2014-01-31]

* Constructors for Rupert Venzke's psi-family of low-entropy braids.

* Fix bug involving single-trajectory dataset.

* Plot empty braids (why not...).

* braid.compact no longer checks for trivial braid, since this can
  take a lot of time (more than the compact itself).

* Unit test for entropy added to testsuite.

* Lighter distribution (just compiled files).

* A few more small bugfixes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.4 [2014-01-03]

* The databraid class records crossing times of a dataset.

* Added an example section on taffy pullers to braidlab guide.

* bugfix in testsuite.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.3 [2013-12-20]

* The braidlab guide has been updated and expanded, and now has a
  table of contents and a detailed index.

* New methods in braid class: 'alexpoly' returns the Alexander
  polynomial.  'burau' can now construct a matrix of Laurent
  polynomials (wavelet toolbox required).  'tensor' is the tensor
  product of braids.

* Big speedup in creating braids from data, due to improved safety
  checks on the particle trajectories.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.2 [2013-12-13]

* loopTest.m in testsuite.

* Clean up files.  Eliminate subrepos.

* First public release.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.1 [2013-12-12]

* Check for overflow of loop coordinates.

* Several bugfixes.

* Improved support for VPI (Variable Precision Integers).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0 [2013-10-02]

First release of braidlab.
