1.1 [2014-xx-xx]

* loopsigma's helper function can now handle int32, int64, single, in
  addition to double.  This makes checking braid equality and
  triviality much faster, unless overflow occurs and VPI has to be
  used.

* The braid constructor can make knot representatives, i.e.,
  b=braid('8_3') for a braid representative for the third 8-crossing
  knot.

* braid.burau and braid.alexpoly can use the symbolic toolbox.

Several improvements to the method braid.entropy:

* It has a C MEX helper function and is much faster.  It no longer
  checks if the braid is trivial, which avoids overflow and speeds up
  the function.

* Its convergence has been greatly improved (see next item for more
  details).  With enough iterations, machine precision can usually be
  achieved.

* Its optional second return argument has changed from a list of
  iterates to the final generalized eigenvector.  The reason is that
  the internal algorithm has changed: the Dynnikov coordinates get
  renormalized at every step, much like the power iteration method for
  finding the largest eigenvalue of a matrix.  A consequence of this
  is that it is no longer natural to store the iterates.  This
  shouldn't affect things very much, since this optional argument was
  not used widely.

1.0.5 [2014-01-31]

* Constructors for Rupert Venzke's psi-family of low-entropy braids.

* Fix bug involving single-trajectory dataset.

* Plot empty braids (why not...).

* braid.compact no longer checks for trivial braid, since this can
  take a lot of time (more than the compact itself).

* Unit test for entropy added to testsuite.

* Lighter distribution (just compiled files).

* A few more small bugfixes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.4 [2014-01-03]

* The databraid class records crossing times of a dataset.

* Added an example section on taffy pullers to braidlab guide.

* bugfix in testsuite.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.3 [2013-12-20]

* The braidlab guide has been updated and expanded, and now has a
  table of contents and a detailed index.

* New methods in braid class: 'alexpoly' returns the Alexander
  polynomial.  'burau' can now construct a matrix of Laurent
  polynomials (wavelet toolbox required).  'tensor' is the tensor
  product of braids.

* Big speedup in creating braids from data, due to improved safety
  checks on the particle trajectories.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.2 [2013-12-13]

* loopTest.m in testsuite.

* Clean up files.  Eliminate subrepos.

* First public release.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.1 [2013-12-12]

* Check for overflow of loop coordinates.

* Several bugfixes.

* Improved support for VPI (Variable Precision Integers).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0 [2013-10-02]

First release of braidlab.
