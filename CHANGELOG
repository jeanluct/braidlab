3.1 [2015-01-11]

* The function braidlab.prop can be used to set global properties,
  such as the way braids are plotted and the direction of rotation for
  generators.

* braidlab.prop can set the absolute tolerance for determining
  coincidence of coordinates when constructing a braid from data
  (property BraidAbsTol).  This replaces the previous relative
  comparison which had been used since 2.0.  (See issue #117.)

* braid.plot takes color and linestyle attributes.

* braid.lk returns the Lawrence-Krammer representation of a braid.

* The class annbraid is used to represent braids on annular domains.

* databraids are displayed differently from braids, with crossing
  times shown.

* The braidlab guide has been expanded with a short introduction to
  braids.

* Setting up alternative compilers is described in the troubleshooting
  section of the guide.

* The taffy example in the guide no longer worked, due to some bugs in
  braid creation code when coincident coordinates are involved.  (See
  issues #116 and #117.)  Note that it is possible that the parallel
  code returns different generator sequences when called multiple
  times on the same dataset.  However, the resulting braids are still
  equal (issue #118).

* Some bugfixes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.0.1 [2014-12-16]

* Improve installation instructions in guide.

* Fix some outdated output in guide.

* Fix a bug when calling C++ version of intersec.

* Fix a bug in braid.mtimes that disallowed valid action on loop
  with basepoint.

* Remove broken braid.reducing.

* Makefile detects Linux 32-bit architecture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.0 [2014-12-09]

* Move from BitBucket/Mercurial to GitHub/Git, to stay with the times.

* Discourage arrays of loop objects.  Instead, multiple loops live
  inside of a single loop object, but subscripting has been overloaded
  for loops.  Externally, a user should see very little difference to
  the interface (and the guide required no changes), but the speedup
  for a braid acting on a large array of loops is of order 50.

* Loop constructor can now return an array of canonical loops.  This
  is useful for pre-allocating memory, among other things.  To make
  this work, the loop constructor form loop(a,b) has been removed (use
  loop([a b]) instead).  This shouldn't affect things much as that
  form was hardly used and was not documented in the guide.

* Loop constructor can take an option 'BasePoint' when creating loops,
  to add an extra puncture.  The basepoint is not allowed to move
  under braid operations.

* Loop constructor: loop(n) now returns a loop with n punctures,
  rather than (n+1).  Use loop(n,'BasePoint') to add the extra puncture.

* loop.n now returns the number of non-basepoint punctures.  Use
  loop.totaln to get the total number of punctures, including the
  basepoint.

* Loop constructor has an option 'Enum' to enumerate a list of loops
  with coordinate values between specified bounds.

* Loop constructor takes 'FullTwist' option.

* loop.minlength is now a C++ MEX file.

* Update braid.plot for Matlab 2014b.

* braid.tensor and databraid.tensor can handle more than one braid at
  a time.  There was also a bug in databraid.tensor: the braids have
  to be interweaved.

* braid.entropy supports different length functions.  The arguments to
  entropy have change significantly.  In particular, the train-track
  algorithm is now specified using entropy(b,'Method','trains').

* databraid.entropy and databraid.complexity are no longer
  implemented.  Instead, use databraid.ftbe (Finite Time Braiding
  Exponent).  This is to distinguish the entropy of data, which
  doesn't necessarily close, to that of a "true" braid.

* databraid now allows generators with simultaneous times, as long as
  all the generators for a given time commute with each other.  This
  affects in particular testing for equality of two databraids.  For
  example, databraid([1 3],[1 1]) and databraid([3 1],[1 1]) are now
  equal.

* More unit tests in the testsuite, especially for cfbraid
  (undocumented class for canonical form braids, but used behind the
  scenes) and databraid.

* And of course, many bugfixes and small tweaks...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 [2014-10-02]

* Simplify the linear action code: instead of braid.linact use an
  optional return argument for braid.mtimes.  braid.cycle now does
  what braid.cyclemat did.  The nitty-gritty pos/neg operators are
  invisible to the user (see issue #65).  None of this should affect
  users, since these were not documented in the guide (but now they
  are).

* Fix detection of some limit cycles (issue #52).  Also allow
  specification of an initial loop when looking for cycles.

* Move some utility functions to namespace +util, to make them less
  visible to user.

* Moved installation instructions to an appendix in the guide.  Added
  a troubleshooting section.

* Renamed the guide and posted on arXiv.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0 [2014-09-24]

* Complete rewrite of the Makefiles to simplify them and make them
  compatible with Matlab 2014a (which broke a lot of things).  The
  Makefiles no longer attempt to detect which compiler MEX uses, so
  you'll have to set it manually if you use a nonstandard one (e.g.,
  'make CXX=g++-4.7.1 CC=gcc-4.7.1').  This has been tested on 64-bit
  Linux and Mac OS.

* When constructing a braid object from data, the braid constructor
  now uses a C++ MEX file (written by Marko Budisic) giving a big
  speedup for large datasets.  Support for parallelization on multiple
  cores is included.  The global variable BRAIDLAB_threads determines
  the number of threads used.

* The braid constructor can make knot representatives, e.g.,
  b=braid('8_3') returns a braid representative for the third
  8-crossing knot.

* The private method braid.loopsigma's C++ helper functions (used by
  braid*loop) can now handle int32, int64, and single, in addition to
  double.  This makes checking braid equality and triviality much
  faster, unless overflow occurs and VPI has to be used.

* The private method braid.loopsigma's C++ helper functions can also
  handle VPI (Variable Precision Integers) by using GMP, the GNU
  MultiPrecision library.  If you don't have GMP installed, compile
  with option "BRAIDLAB_USE_GMP=0".  However, this will lead to a
  massive slowdown when working with VPI types (Variable Precision
  Integers).

* New methods in the loop class: loop.components, loop.plot
  'Components' option, loop.getgraph.  These are not yet documented in
  the guide, as they are an advanced feature, though they are
  described in the help text to the functions.

* braid.burau and braid.alexpoly can use the symbolic toolbox.
  alexpoly no longer centers the polynomial by default, since
  centering cannot always be used with a laurpoly object, and can
  never be used for integral types.  Use option 'centered'.

* braid.mtimes acting on loops has an optional output argument that
  records the signs of the pos/neg operators in the update rules
  (loopsigma).  This allows reconstruction of the matrix for the
  effective linear action, as well as checking for limit cycles for
  the action.

* New methods in the braid class: braid.linact converts the optional
  output from braid.mtimes (see above) to a matrix.  braid.cycle looks
  for a limit cycle in the braid action on loops.  braid.cyclemat uses
  braid.cycle to return a matrix corresponding to this limit cycle.
  The largest eigenvalue of this matrix, normalized by the period,
  gives the Perron root of the largest pseudo-Anosov component(s).
  This is not documented in the guide yet, because it's still a bit
  experimental.  In particular it sometimes fails to find the limit
  cycle (issue #52).

* Many other small bugfixes and improvements.

Several improvements to the method braid.entropy:

* braid.entropy has a C MEX helper function and is much faster.  It no
  longer checks if the braid is trivial, which avoids overflow and
  speeds up the function.

* braid.entropy's convergence has been greatly improved (see next item
  for more details).  With enough iterations, machine precision can
  usually be achieved.

* braid.entropy's optional second return argument has changed from a
  list of iterates to the final generalized eigenvector.  The reason
  is that the internal algorithm has changed: the Dynnikov coordinates
  get renormalized at every step, much like the power iteration method
  for finding the largest eigenvalue of a matrix.  A consequence of
  this is that it is no longer natural to store the iterates.  This
  shouldn't affect things very much, since this optional argument was
  not used widely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.5 [2014-01-31]

* Constructors for Rupert Venzke's psi-family of low-entropy braids.

* Fix bug involving single-trajectory dataset.

* Plot empty braids (why not...).

* braid.compact no longer checks for trivial braid, since this can
  take a lot of time (more than the compact itself).

* Unit test for entropy added to testsuite.

* Lighter distribution (just compiled files).

* A few more small bugfixes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.4 [2014-01-03]

* The databraid class records crossing times of a dataset.

* Added an example section on taffy pullers to braidlab guide.

* bugfix in testsuite.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.3 [2013-12-20]

* The braidlab guide has been updated and expanded, and now has a
  table of contents and a detailed index.

* New methods in braid class: 'alexpoly' returns the Alexander
  polynomial.  'burau' can now construct a matrix of Laurent
  polynomials (wavelet toolbox required).  'tensor' is the tensor
  product of braids.

* Big speedup in creating braids from data, due to improved safety
  checks on the particle trajectories.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.2 [2013-12-13]

* loopTest.m in testsuite.

* Clean up files.  Eliminate subrepos.

* First public release.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.1 [2013-12-12]

* Check for overflow of loop coordinates.

* Several bugfixes.

* Improved support for VPI (Variable Precision Integers).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0 [2013-10-02]

First release of braidlab.
