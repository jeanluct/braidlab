It can be a little tricky to get MEX files to work with Matlab.  The
XCode developer SDK needs to be installed (to get GCC).  Then, after
running 'mex -setup' (mex has to be in the search path), edit
.matlab/R201xx/mexopts.sh.  Look for the line

SDKROOT='/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk'

and change to

SDKROOT='/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk'

Make sure to doublecheck that this folder exists.

You might also update

MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET='10.7'

though I'm not sure that's needed.
