function phi = totient(N)
% vpi/totient: the number of positive integers less than N that are coprime to N
% usage: phi = totient(N)
%
% Euler's totient function, as defined by
%
% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_totient_function
%
% phi is the number of positive integers that are
% both less than N and coprime (relatively prime)
% to N.
%
% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime
%
% Totient requires the factors of N, so if N is
% very large, this might take a while.
%
%
% Example:
%  When N is a prime, N will be coprime
%  to all of the N-1 positive numbers less
%  than N.
%
%  totient(17)
% ans =
%     16
%
% Example:
%  totient(36)
% ans =
%     12
%
%  Show this to be correct, since the numbers
%  less than 36 that are coprime to 36 are
%  easily generated.
%
%  cp = [];
%  for i = 1:35
%    if gcd(i,36) == 1
%      cp = [cp,i];
%    end
%  end
%
%  cp
% cp =
%    1  5  7 11 13 17 19 23 25 29 31 35
%
% Of course, there are 12 such numbers in
% the list.

% Example:
%  P = vpi('16867914157');
%  totient(P)
% ans =
