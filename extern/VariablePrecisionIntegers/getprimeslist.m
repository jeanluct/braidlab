% load the compressed form
load _primeslist_

% these are uint8 numbers, where I simply stored
% difference between consecutive primes as a uint8.
% this works, since the largest such difference was
% never more than 220 up to that point.
% The act of decompressing the list takes no more
% than a double and a cumsum.
primeslist = cumsum([2,double(primeslist)]);
