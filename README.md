*trains* is a C++ library originally written by **[Toby Hall](http://www.liv.ac.uk/~tobyhall/T_Hall.html)**.   It is an implementation of Bestvina and Handel's algorithm for determining train tracks of surface homeomorphisms (Topology **34** (1995), 109-140).

As Toby only maintains a version of *trains* with a graphical interface for Windows, this is based on the last command-line version (trains4).  **Toby Hall is not responsible for bugs in this GitHub version of the software, since he is not involved in its maintenance.**

The code is maintained by **[Jean-Luc Thiffeault](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~jeanluc)**.  It is being updated to run on current C++ compilers.
