Tutorial: how to get MEX files to run on Ubuntu 11.04.

The problem is that Ubuntu 11.04 uses GCC-4.5, and Matlab MEX files
require GCC-4.3 or earlier (for Matlab R2011a and R2011b).  The second
problem is that in Ubuntu 10.10 one could install GCC-4.3 alongside
the newer compiler, but this is no longer supported in 11.04.

Hence, we have to download, compile, and install GCC-4.3 from sources!
Bummer.

(*** But first a small fix which prevent Matlab from complaining on startup:
see http://morganbye.net/blog/2011/05/matlab-ubuntu-1104

For 64 bit:

    sudo ln -s /lib64/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.13.so /lib64/libc.so.6

For 32 bit:

    sudo ln -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc-2.13.so /lib/libc.so.6
***)

Check that the commands 'matlab' and 'mex' are on your path.
Typically, 'which mex' and 'which matlab' should tell you they're in
/usr/local/bin.

We'll need a couple of header file libraries:

    sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev libgmp3-dev

For 64-bit Ubuntu, also install to cross-compiling libraries:

    sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386

    # Needed?
    #sudo ln -s /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/asm /usr/include/asm
    #sudo ln -s /usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/asm /usr/include/asm

Let's download the sources. cd to some work directory with lots of
space.  For instance,

    cd /tmp; mkdir gcc-tmp; cd gcc-tmp

Type (all on one line):

    wget http://gcc.petsads.us/releases/gcc-4.3.6/gcc-core-4.3.6.tar.bz2 \
       http://gcc.petsads.us/releases/gcc-4.3.6/gcc-fortran-4.3.6.tar.bz2 \
       http://gcc.petsads.us/releases/gcc-4.3.6/gcc-g++-4.3.6.tar.bz2

This will take a little while (about 30MB is downloaded).  Next, untar
the files:

    tar xvjf gcc-core-4.3.6.tar.bz2
    tar xvjf gcc-g++-4.3.6.tar.bz2
    tar xvjf gcc-fortran-4.3.6.tar.bz2

Now type

    mkdir gcc-build; cd gcc-build
    ../gcc-4.3.6/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.3.6

Make sure there are no errors.  And finally, compile away!

    make

This should take a while.  After it's done, type

    sudo make install

to install all the files to /usr/local/gcc-4.3.6.

Now that this is done, let's configure MEX/Matlab.  Type

    mex -setup

(*** If you get an error "mex: unrecognized option '-setup'", your mex
command in /usr/local/bin is being shadowed by the Polish latex
packages in /usr/bin.  If you don't need those, run

    sudo apt-get remove texlive-lang-polish

This removes the package.  Then log out and into a new terminal window
to update the path variable. ***)

Choose option 1, configure for gcc.  Then tell it to save to to
the home folder by answering 'y'.  Now the mexopts.sh file is
read-only, so type

    chmod u+w ~/.matlab/<Matlab version>/mexopts.sh

<Matlab version> is probably R2011a or R2011b.  Next edit the file.
Search and replace the *first two* instances of each of these:

 * 'gcc'      and replace with '/usr/local/gcc-4.3.6/bin/gcc'
 * 'g++'      and replace with '/usr/local/gcc-4.3.6/bin/g++'
 * 'gfortran' and replace with '/usr/local/gcc-4.3.6/bin/gfotran'

So you should be replacing a total of 6 items.  (Well, it doesn't hurt
to replace the other instances, but it's not necessary.)

And we're done!  MEX files should compile correctly now.  It's now
safe to delete the /tmp/gcc-tmp folder and its contents:

    rm -rf /tmp/gcc-tmp
