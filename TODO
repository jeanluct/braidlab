 * General, consistent renaming of functions.
    * For instance: no function name should begin with braid, since
      that's part of the namespace now.
    * loopsigma is also a bad name.
      [crossings is for generators; intersections is for loops.]

 * Make a @loop subfolder.  Should go in there:
    * Instead of loopsigma, create a loop object, and have a method to
      compute the product of a braid and a loop?  Only enfore that the
      number of punctures be at least n when acting with a braid,
      since we may want more punctures (as for normal form).
    * What type for the loop entries?
    * loopplot.m, loopsigma.m, loopinter.m, and loopsigma_helper.c in
      a private foldef.
    * Is it easy to determine the 'true' length of a loop from its
      coords?  That would be useful for Sarah's work.
    * Should loopcoords become a constructor for a loop (from a braid)?

 * braid class:
    * entropy method.  Use the [010101...01] of Dehornoy?  Try to speed it up.
    * ensure int32 for elements.

 * cfbraid class: (for braid in canonical form)

 * Check types when invoking MEX files.

 * creating braids from data:
    * Projection line angle.
    * Do we need color_braiding_sub?  Maybe write something that works
      from the braid directly.

 * Move interpcross to private.

 * Makefile:
    * Once +loop folder is added, make another Makefile in there.
    * Avoid rebuilding libcbraid every time a CPP file is compiled:
      can we run a command once at the start of a Makefile?
    * Makefile.matlab for cbraid: build special library. Or Makefile.cbraid.


Which functions could benefit from MEXing?
