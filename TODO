 * General, consistent renaming of functions.
    * For instance: no function name should begin with braid, since
      that's part of the namespace now.
    * loopsigma is also a bad name.
      [crossings is for generators; intersections is for loops.]

 * Make a @loop subfolder.  Should go in there:
    * loopplot.m, loopsigma.m, loopinter.m, and loopsigma_helper.c in
      a private foldef.  [Well, need to keep vectorized version.  Not
      sure how to do that.  Have a class "loops"?]
    * recover crossing numbers: see dynn2cross.
    * What type for the loop entries?
    * Is it easy to determine the 'true' length of a loop from its
      coords?  That would be useful for Sarah's work.

 * braid class:
    * entropy method.  Use the [010101...01] of Dehornoy?  Try to speed it up.
    * ensure int32 for elements.

 * cfbraid class: (for braid in canonical form)

 * closure: implement various options, in particular "lowest L2" and
   maybe "lowest entropy".  Do these have to scale as n! ?

 * Check types when invoking MEX files.

 * creating braids from data:
    * Projection line angle.
    * Do we need color_braiding_sub?  Maybe write something that works
      from the braid directly.


Which functions could benefit from MEXing?
