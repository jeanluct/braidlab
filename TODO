 * General, consistent renaming of functions.
    * For instance: no function name should begin with braid, since
      that's part of the namespace now.
    * loopsigma is also a bad name.
      [crossings is for generators; intersections is for loops.]

 * loop class:
    * loopplot.m, loopsigma.m, loopinter.m, and loopsigma_helper.c in
      a private foldef.  [Well, need to keep vectorized version.  Not
      sure how to do that.  Have a class "loops"?]
    * What type for the loop entries?
    * loopplot: puncture size, clipping left/right, join like Toby.
    * problems: geometric intersection number of two loops, number of
      connected components.

 * braid class:
    * ensure int32 for elements.
    * plot method.
    * train track (see Flop/Matlab).
    * For data: tube, Matt's "sexify" command to make things look good.
    * cycliceq: show [1 -2 3 -4] cyclically same as [1 -2 -4 3].
      [1 -2 3 -4] = [-2 3 -4 1] = [-2 3 1 -4] = [-2 1 3 -4] = [1 3 -2 -4]
      [1 -2 -4 3] = [-2 -4 3 1] = [-2 -4 1 3] = [3 -2 -4 1] = [1 3 -2 -4]
      This is the same as saying their closure gives the same knot?
      Doesn't seem to be a matter of just permuting and trying possibilities:
		>> a=braid([1 -2 3 -4]);
		>> b=braid([1 -2 -4 3]); a==b
		ans = 0
		>> b=braid([-2 -4 3 1]); a==b
		ans = 0
		>> b=braid([-4 3 1 -2]); a==b
		ans = 0
		>> b=braid([3 1 -2 -4]); a==b
		ans = 0
      Why?  Because we may have to "commute periodically" several
      times.  Is this a hard problem?  Or maybe they really aren't the
      same and I'm cheating somehow by using the periodicity several
      times.

 * cfbraid class: (for braid in canonical form)

 * closure: implement various options, in particular "lowest L2" and
   maybe "lowest entropy".  Do these have to scale as n! ?

 * Check types when invoking MEX files.

 * creating braids from data:
    * Projection line angle.
    * Do we need color_braiding_sub?  Maybe write something that works
      from the braid directly.

 * Testing:
    * Random walk entropy.

 * Which functions could benefit from MEXing?

 * Check if MEX file exists, compile?
