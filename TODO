 * General, consistent renaming of functions.
    * This is less important now with private methods and functions.
    * For instance: no function name should begin with braid, since
      that's part of the namespace now.
    * loopsigma is also a bad name.
      [crossings is for generators; intersections is for loops.]
    * looplistsigma.m and looplistsigma_helper.c: rename to avoid
      sigma?  Adapt so that looplistsigma takes a braid and returns a
      cell array [no! just array is ok] of loops.  This shouldn't slow
      it down since the resulting cell array is fairly small.  Should
      make braid member function. [no, better to put it as part of lcs
      namespace.]

 * loop class:
    * What type for the loop entries?
    * loop.plot: puncture size, clipping left/right, join like Toby.
    * problems: geometric intersection number of two loops, number of
      connected components.

 * braid class:

    * color_braiding: perturb projection line rather than trajectories
      when coincidence found?  Or just report error message.  Maybe
      better to just report error and let user deal with it by
      changing the projection line.
    * color_braiding: option to minimize crossings over projection line?
    * ensure int32 for elements [2012-01-17: MRA ran into a problem
      with this; discuss.].
    * train track (see Flop/Matlab).
    * For data: tube, Matt's "sexify" command to make things look good.
    * cycliceq: show [1 -2 3 -4] cyclically same as [1 -2 -4 3].
      [1 -2 3 -4] = [-2 3 -4 1] = [-2 3 1 -4] = [-2 1 3 -4] = [1 3 -2 -4]
      [1 -2 -4 3] = [-2 -4 3 1] = [-2 -4 1 3] = [3 -2 -4 1] = [1 3 -2 -4]
      This is the same as saying their closure gives the same knot?
      Doesn't seem to be a matter of just permuting and trying possibilities:
		>> a=braid([1 -2 3 -4]);
		>> b=braid([1 -2 -4 3]); a==b
		ans = 0
		>> b=braid([-2 -4 3 1]); a==b
		ans = 0
		>> b=braid([-4 3 1 -2]); a==b
		ans = 0
		>> b=braid([3 1 -2 -4]); a==b
		ans = 0
      Why?  Because we may have to "commute periodically" several
      times.  Is this a hard problem?  Or maybe they really aren't the
      same and I'm cheating somehow by using the periodicity several
      times.
    * compact_helper: group same generators together.
    * burau rep: use rational polynomials, somehow.

 * Extract reducing curve from Toby's code? (in Dynnikov coords)

 * cfbraid class: (for braid in canonical form)

 * closure: implement various options, in particular "lowest L2" and
   maybe "lowest entropy".  Do these have to scale as (n!)?  Maybe
   find some cases where we have a target entropy, that is, we can
   generate a very long braid so we can compute the entropy, but we'd
   like to estimate the entropy from a subset of that.  (Use Duffing
   in the chaotic sea?)

 * Check types when invoking MEX files.

 * Testing:
    * Random walk entropy.

 * Which functions could benefit from MEXing?

 * Check if MEX file exists, compile?

 * Good mathematical name for an open braid (tangle is already taken)?
   How about the process of turning an open braid into a true braid?
   "Closure" already means something different, but maybe that's the
   right thing.  "Completion"?  "Closed extension"?  "Braid
   extension"?  Start writing notes formalizing this.  Can still
   define topological equivalence rel the punctures.  Form a groupoid,
   a group-like structure where not all the elements can be multiplied
   together.
