BRAIDLAB STYLE GUIDE
--------------------

If you wish to participate in developing Braidlab, below are some
stylistic guidelines to adhere to.  The easiest way to ensure
compliance, of course, is to simply start a new file by copying an
appropriate existing one.


GENERAL
-------

* No tabs; always use spaces instead.
* Delete extra whitespace at the end of lines, or at the end of files.
* Every file should end with a linebreak.
* Break lines at 78 characters unless there is a compelling reason not
  to (e.g., long URL).
* Indentation in blocks is two spaces.
* Please spell-check and proofread your comments and help messages!
  We're not animals: we try to write well.


VERSION CONTROL
---------------

* Use a descriptive log message for commits.  If you use more than one
  line, the first line should be a summary.
* The log message should have proper punctuation and end with a period.
* When relevant, refer to issues on the bitbucket tracker using #.
  Example: "Start implementing new feature.  See issue #45."
* Using "closes issue #45" or "resolves issue #45" will automatically
  resolve an issue.  This is a good thing to add to a log message, but
  be careful not to say "does not resolve issue #45"!


MATLAB .m FILES
---------------

* Here is an example of formatting for function help:

function [varargout] = tntype(b)
%TNTYPE   Thurston-Nielsen type of a braid.
%   T = TNTYPE(B) returns the Thurston-Nielsen type of a braid B.  The braid
%   is regarded as labeling an isotopy class on the punctured disk.  The
%   type T can take the values 'finite-order', 'reducible', or
%   'pseudo-Anosov', following the Thurston-Nielsen classification theorem.
%
%   [T,ENTR] = TNTYPE(B) also returns the entropy ENTR of the braid.
%
%   TNTYPE uses Toby Hall's implementation of the Bestvina-Handel algorithm.
%

%   Topology 34 (1995), 109-140.

%   homeomorphisms," http://www.liv.ac.uk/~tobyhall/T_Hall.html

%   surfaces," Bull. Am. Math. Soc. 19 (1988), 417-431.
%
%   This is a method for the BRAID class.
%   See also BRAID, BRAID.ENTROPY.

  Note that three spaces are used between the bold function name and
  the one-line summary.  Three spaces are also used for indenting
  thereafter.  This is to be consistent with Matlab style.  The
  one-line summary has punctuation.

* Global variables should be avoided as much as possible, but if they
  are needed should be of the form BRAIDLAB_global_variable_name, with
  the latter part in all lowercase.


C/C++ FILES
-----------

* Braidlab-specific macros and compiler flags should have the form
  BRAIDLAB_COMPILER_FLAG, all in uppercase.
* In MEX files use the Matlab macros mwSize for size of arrays and
  mwIndex for indexing into them.  Use mwSignedIndex for differences
  between indices.  See
