DynnikovWiest_TransmRelax.mws is Bert Wiest's Maple code implementing the
transmission-relaxation algorithm.

(Works with Maple >= 14.)

See http://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/bertold.wiest/logi.html

From Bert's website:

"Here is a maple worksheet written by Michel Bonnefont and Erwan
Hillion (using some elements of an earlier program by Juan
Gonzalez-Meneses, and with a bug fixed later by myself), which
illustrates the braid untangling procedure described in my paper with
Ivan Dynnikov. (When they wrote this program, Michel Bonnefont and
Erwan Hillion were 1st-year students in the magist√®re in mathematics
at the ENS in Ker Lann.)"

Note that it must be run in a folder that doesn't contain certain
Matlab m-files, since some share the same name as Maple functions.
