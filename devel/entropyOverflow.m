function Ls = entropyOverflow(strands, Ntries)
%% Ls = entropyOverflow(strands, Ntries)
% Push braidlab to entropy overflow, just to test the boundaries.
%
% We generate braids of pre-specified number of strands with more
% and more generators, until the entropy computation overflows. Then
% we do a simple binary search to zero in on precisely the number of
% generators causing overflow.
%
% Generators are drawn at random using uniform distribution over
% numbers between (-Nstrands, Nstrands). Braidlab automatically
% discards sigma_0 generators, meaning that the braids sometimes end
% up being shorter than recorded, as sigma_0 should not correspond
% to any operation. We don't attempt to correct for that number.
%
% ** Inputs: **
%
% strands - list of numbers of strands for which to test, e.g., [3,
% 10, 100]
%
% Ntries  - attempts to determine at which length of braid overflow
% happens (optional)
%
% ** Outputs: **
%
%Ls      - number of generators in the braid causing overflow
%
